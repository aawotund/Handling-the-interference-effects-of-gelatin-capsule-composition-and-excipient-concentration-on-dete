# Minimizing the interference of pill coatings for near-IR detection of  substandard and falsified pharmaceuticals







A portable Near Infra Red (NIR) spectometer was ecplored in this study to probe lab formulated Isoniazid(IS) as well as Doxycycline(DE) samples housed in broad spectrum of coated capsules including capsules made from vegetable cellulose and gelatin. The capsules are of varying opacity which introduce variations similar to real life scenerios associated different capssule coatings by manufacturers.

Isoniazid and alpha crystalline cellulose were formulated in the lab with active pharmaceuticals ingredients (API)- Isoniazid content (w/w) used in the regression studies. We used this as hypothetical study as most Isoniazid exist in tablet forms rather than in capsules. A real life case study used Doxycyline as Doxycyline exist in capsules.

Binary mixture of Doxycyline hydrate (ALFA AESAR) and alpha-lactose (Sigma) were formulated in the lab with active pharmaceuticals ingredients (API)- Doxycyline hydrate- content used in the regression studies.
